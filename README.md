# Surviving-Maps

## Where has the website gone?
As per the posts on Reddit, I was not receiving enough support via the Kofi link to continue paying out of my own pocket. 
However, due to the generosity of other users, we might be able to get back up and running at some point. 

## So what's this?
This is a repository to allow users to run the code themselves on their own computer. This is likely to be a stop gap, but some users might choose to run it locally or modify it if they want to dabble in some coding.

## How do I install it?

### Downloading the Code

As should be said with any code run from the internet, there are risks involved. I haven't tested this on any machines
but my own.
This is the point where you are downloading and running software that is unverified and probably contains bugs.
Java's Virtual Machine should prevent these bugs causing system instabilities, but I take no responsibility whatsoever.

The complete code can be downloaded from the green "code" button on
the [github page](https://github.com/trickster-is-weak/Surviving-Maps). You can then choose to download the code as a
zip, or using git if you have that installed. After you have it downloaded and unzipped, open a Terminal/Command Prompt
at this location.

### Using docker
If you have docker configured on your system the process to install this game is fairly simple. Just open a Terminal/Command Prompt
at Surviving-Maps folder and execute the following command.

```shell
docker build --file=Dockerfile  -t SurvivingMaps .
```
You will notice the code getting compiled and may take few minutes to complete, this will happen only for the first time to generate docker image, also
remember that this command should only be executed once just to create the image. After the compilation is successfull, execute the next command.

```shell
docker run -it -p 80:80 --name web SurvivingMaps
```
This command should be used everytime you want to start the game.

This should start printing a load of stuff out on the screen such as files it's reading, and other logging information.

When it stops, it will probably have something like 

```shell
[INFO ] 2022-11-10 19:53:38.431 [restartedMain] SpringApplication - Started SpringApplication in 10.892 seconds (JVM running for 12.011)
<=======------> 60% EXECUTING [11m 59s]
> :run
```
Now we can go to our browser and navigate to "http://localhost". This should load the splash page and the page is lauched successfuly.

To exit, you can close the webpage and execute the following commands

```shell
docker kill web
docker rm web
```

**If you don't have docker, use the following steps**
### Precursors
So the app needs things installed on your local machine before it will work: Java and Gradle.
0. Some engineering spirit and appetite for risk
1. Java JDK, this can be downloaded from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
2. Gradle is a build tool that is used to link to other software libraries. Details on installation can be found [here](https://gradle.org/install/).

#### Verification

To test these have been installed correctly it is easiest to use the terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).
There are plenty of guides for installing these in a lot more detail. 

```shell
java -version
```

This should return with something like:

```shell
java version "17.0.3.1" 2022-04-22 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.3.1+2-LTS-6)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.3.1+2-LTS-6, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Then
```shell
gradle -version
```
This should return with something like:
```shell
------------------------------------------------------------
Gradle 7.4.2
------------------------------------------------------------

Build time:   2022-03-31 15:25:29 UTC
Revision:     540473b8118064efcc264694cbcaa4b677f61041

Kotlin:       1.5.31
Groovy:       3.0.9
Ant:          Apache Ant(TM) version 1.10.11 compiled on July 10 2021
JVM:          18.0.1.1 (Homebrew 18.0.1.1+0)
OS:           Mac OS X 12.6.1 x86_64
```

#### Verification

Run the `ls` command in Mac/Linux or `dir` in windows. It should return the contents of the folder like:

```shell
build.gradle	database	gradlew		logs		src
gradle		gradlew.bat	settings.gradle
```

If you do not see `src`, `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle`, you're in the wrong place.

### Running the code

When you first run the code, it will fetch a load of libraries from the internet. This will only happen on the first run, or after an update.
These files are all from [MVN Repository](https://mvnrepository.com). It will then compile and run the code.  

Run the code using:
```shell
gradle run
```

This should start printing a load of stuff out on the screen such as files it's reading, and other logging information.

When it stops, it will probably have something like 

```shell
[INFO ] 2022-11-10 19:53:38.431 [restartedMain] SpringApplication - Started SpringApplication in 10.892 seconds (JVM running for 12.011)
<=======------> 60% EXECUTING [11m 59s]
> :run
```

Which is good... now we can go to our browser and navigate to "http://localhost". This should load the splash page.

#### Ending the run
The code will remain running after you shut the webpage. It can be stopped by closing the terminal window or Control+C.  


## Advanced Settings
If you have something running on port 80 already, it can be changed in the src/main/resources/application.properties file. 
Change the line `server.port=80` to another number, say 8080, the URL will now be "http://localhost:8080".
